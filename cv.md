### About Me
I graduated from Moscow State University with a degree in computational mathematics and cybernetics. Now I'm working as a frontend developer at company named KaspiTravel. We are developing the top-1 application in Kazakhstan for buying air and train tickets. Now I'm working using the Angular framework. I like to learn something new, to set myself challenges and try to fulfill them. I think that my main quality is that I learn something new very quickly, if I'm really interested in it.
